# Notes for Data Mining

## Probability

P(h), the probability that some hypothesis h is true, is called the **prior probability** of h.
Before we have any evidence, the probability of a person owning a Mac is 0.6 (the evidence
might be knowing that the person also owns an iPhone).

P(h|d) is called the **posterior probability** of h. After we observe some data d what is the
probability of h? For example, after we observe that a person owns an iPhone, what is the
probability of that same person owning a Mac? It is also called **conditional probability**.

**P(D)** is the probability that some training data will be observed.

**P(D|h)** is the probability that some data value holds given the hypothesis.
